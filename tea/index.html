<h2><u>Trajectory Tea</u></h2>

<h3>
<br>
Also known as the trundle tea is a system inspired by the ferris wheel. A tea cup shaped canister is where the martian tea leaves and milk is blended.<br>
 <br><br> A bunch of pipes emerge from the canister into the little tea cups where accents are added for flavours which leave you asking for more.<br>
<br> When it comes to keeping our incessantly working brigade of astronauts awake, none else can be trusted.<br>
